# Security Policy
This document provides an overview of our security policies for this repository. This covers all portions of NeonRelay software. This applies to all users of our software with no exceptions. It is important to note that LTS releases have an additional four year period of support in addition to the same version's non-LTS release. This will reduce payment during this time period, but will lower the need to update.
## Supported Versions

The below table specifies the year in which important security updates for NeonRelay software will expire. The exact date in which your software package expires is dependent on the date in which you have first connected to the NeonRelay network. After your support period expires, you will no longer be able to connect to the NeonRelay network unless you update to the latest version. If you have automatic updates enabled (and the new version supports restart-free upgrades) your version will be automatically updated. During this time period, you may not be able to add money to your NeonRelay wallet from your hardware. If the update is not restart-free, you will need to manually restart your server before continuing. After updating, you will most liekly need to configure new features added in a particular update. Previous settings, including your NonRelay authentication information, will be saved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you see a vulneraility, report it as soon as possible. In order to do so, instead of creating a Github issue, please contact us at security@neonrelay.com. This ensures that conversaitons between NeonRelay staff and you are not disclosed to the public and exploited. NeonRelay encrypts all of its Emails and supports PGP verification on all of its security inboxes. When writing an Email to our security team, include a detailed analysis of the vulnerability, including affected systems, attack vectors, and possible solutions. Never give any information related to security data over the phone or Github. These are insecure methods and may result in the exploitation of a vulnerability.

### External Vulnerabilities
If a security vulnerability includes an external dependency or software provider, it is important to contact both us and the other provider in question. Please follow their instructions on vulnerability reporting, in addition to ours.
